# PyOBD Professional Dashboard

A modern, open-source OBD-II diagnostic tool and dashboard built with Python. Designed to work with **ELM327 USB adapters**, this tool allows you to monitor vehicle sensors in real-time, read/clear check engine lights, and log data for analysis.

## Features

*   **Live Dashboard:** Real-time visualization of RPM, Speed, Coolant Temp, Voltage, and more.
*   **Live Graphing:** Distinct multi-axis graphing to correlate data (e.g., RPM vs. Fuel Pressure).
*   **Automated Analysis:** Built-in logic engine to detect anomalies (e.g., high load at idle, overheating) based on sensor combinations.
*   **Customizable Layout:** Toggle which sensors you want to see on the screen via the Settings tab.
*   **Data Logging:** Automatically save sensor data to CSV files for Excel/Sheets analysis.
*   **Diagnostics:** Read and Clear Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs / Check Engine Light).
*   **Safety Backups:** "Full Backup" feature saves a snapshot of the car's state (Freeze Frame data + Codes) to a JSON file before you wipe them.
*   **Demo Mode:** Built-in simulation to test features without being connected to a car.
*   **Dark Mode UI:** Built with `CustomTkinter` for a modern look.

## Professional Data Packs

The open-source version supports standard OBD-II protocols (Emissions, RPM, Speed, Temps). However, manufacturers often hide specific data (Hybrid Battery Health, DPF Soot Levels, Transmission Temp) behind proprietary codes.

**Pro Packs are available for purchase on our Gumroad store.**

These JSON packs unlock manufacturer-specific sensors for brands like Toyota, VW, Ford, and BMW etc.

Do you have a specific car? If you help me verify the PIDs, I will give you the Pro Pack for free.

### How to install a Pro Pack:
1.  Purchase/Download the `.json` file for your car model.
2.  Place the file inside the `pro_packs/` folder in the application directory.
3.  Open the App → **Settings** → **Manage Pro Packs**.
4.  Enable the pack and click "Save & Reload".

## Hardware Requirements

*   **Computer:** Windows, Linux, or macOS.
*   **Adapter:** ELM327 USB Adapter.
    *   *Recommended:* Version with **PIC18F25K80** chip and **FTDI** or **CH340** USB drivers.
    *   *Note:* Avoid generic "blue" KKL/VAG-COM cables; they are not ELM327 compatible.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Paul-HenryP/PyOBD-Dashboard.git
    cd PyOBD-Dashboard
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Connect your Adapter:**
    *   Plug the ELM327 USB into your computer.
    *   Plug the other end into your car's OBD-II port.
    *   Turn the ignition to **ON** (Engine can be off or running).

## Usage

**Running via Python:**
```bash
python src/main.py
```

## Using the Interface:
Select your USB Port from the dropdown (or use "Auto").
Select "Demo Mode" to test the interface without a cable.
Click Connect.
