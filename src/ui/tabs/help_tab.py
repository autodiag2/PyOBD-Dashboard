            "   By default, the Dashboard and Graph tabs only send 'Read Data' (Mode 01/22) requests. "
            "   These requests asks the ECU to report a value. They do not attempt to change settings, "

            "   The application uses an 'Interlaced Polling' engine. It prioritizes critical sensors "
            "   (RPM, Speed) while slowing down requests for static data (Fuel Level). This prevents "

            "   interrupted by diagnostic traffic.\n\n"

            "   The 'Clear Codes' command is the only write command available. It is protected by "
            "   a confirmation dialog and a motion lock (disabled while driving)."
